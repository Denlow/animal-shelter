      Great choice selecting for <span>"THE PERUVIAN SLOTH!"</span> These animals are an incredibly uncommon pet any American's have ever owned. They are endiginous to South America and they are illegal to bring to the US. Cute, cuddly, slow, and with VERY sharp claws, these guys are the perfect animals to spoil. They won't go anywhere very fast, and thus, are one of the easiest animals to contain. You could leave for work, go out to dinner, see a concert, and come home next week and your sloth will have barely moved. Feed them whatever you want! They're not dogs and won't get hurt, but they also arent human and cant respond with feedback. This makes the Peruvian Sloth one of the BEST choices in pets.
