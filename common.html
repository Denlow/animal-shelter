      Great choice selecting "DOG!"" Dogs are not difficult animals, and they tend to wait around for you to return home. Keep your doors locked and/or closed at all times during their leash period. Also remember to get socket protectors and a baby crib until he grows out of it, as we recommend you NOT let your dog sleep longterm in a bed for fear of rollover minutes.
