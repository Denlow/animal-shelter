      Excellent choice in selecting for "DRAGON." Dragon's are native to scotland, have an incredible affection for the bagpipes, and don't need much water to grow. Once you see the stalk appearing from out of the egg, you know your Dragon's about to take root. Give him a name maybe, or just wait until he's ready to fly the nest. Just remember though, Dragon's are like elephants- they never forget. So when they fly the nest, be prepared for them to come back into your life when they become dragon parents.
      <h4>Want our suggestion? Dragons breathe fire, so have lots of water on hand.</h4>
